             <h2><p><i>Ingredients</i></p></h2>
             <ul>
                <li>1 pound ground turkey</li>
                <li>1 to 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp pepper</li>
             </ul>
             <h2><p><i>Instructions</i></p></h2>
             <ol>
                <p><li>In a mixing bowl, gently knead together turkey, olive oil,<br>
                    Worcestershire sauce, salt, and pepper. Don't overwork the meat.</li></p>
                <p><li>Form into patties about 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick. Press your thumb<br>
                    down on the middle to give it a slight indent.</li></p>
                <p><li>Heat a large heavy skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat.<br>
                    Or, heat an outdoor grill to medium-high heat (400-450 degrees F).<br>
                    Make sure the grate is well oiled so the meat doesn't stick.</li></p>
                <p><li>Cook burgers for about 5 minutes per side, flipping half-way<br>
                    through. Ground turkey needs to be cooked to an internal<br>
                    temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit. You can remove them<br>
                    from the grill or pan at 160 degrees and let rest for 5 minutes, until<br>
                    they reach 165 degrees F, while you prepare your toppings.</li></p>
                <p><li>Let rest 5 minutes, or until internal temperature reaches 165 degrees.</li></p>
             </ol>
