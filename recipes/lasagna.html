              <h2><p>Instructions</p></h2>
              <ol>
                <p><li>In a large pot over medium heat, add in ground sausage and ground beef.<br>
                    Use a spoon to break up the meat into small pieces. Add in onion and garlic and cook until meat is well browned, stirring constantly.<br>
                    Stir in sugar, fresh basil, fennel, oregano, 1/2 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 1/4 cup chopped parsley. Pour in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and wine*.<br>
                    Stir well and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to low and simmer 1-4 hours, stirring occasionally.</li></p>
                <p><li>Meanwhile, place lasagna noodles into the bottom of a pan.<br>
                    Pour hot tap water directly over the noodles, making sure the pasta is completely immersed in the water.<br>
                    Let them soak for 30 minutes, then drain and discard water.</li></p>
                <p><li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and nutmeg. Refrigerate until ready to assemble lasagna.</li></p>
                <p><li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Lightly grease a deep 9x13 pan.</li></p>
                <p><li>To assemble, spread about 1 cup of meat sauce in the bottom of the prepared pan. Place 4 noodles on top.<br>
                    Spread with 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/4 of mozzarella cheese slices.<br>
                    Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, then sprinkle with 1/4 cup parmesan cheese. Repeat layering two more times to create three complete layers.<br>
                    To finish, place a final layer of pasta, topped with another 1 cup of meat sauce to cover the pasta.<br>
                    Top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover loosely with aluminum foil.</li></p>
                <p><li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes to allow cheese to brown. Serve hot.</li></p>
